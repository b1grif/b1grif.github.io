title: This Week In Powershell
---

This week, my powershell time has been applied to someone everyone hates...Windows updates. We use PDQ Inventory and Deploy,
which are excellent products. Deploy is great at pushing packages unfortunately PDQ only packages the monthly rollups
and not other things like .Net or Office patches. So I turned to the PSWindowsUpdate module to help me get these patches
automated. PS PSWindowsUpdate has been another amazing module.

The script is being deployed with an Install step in PDQD. The script does a few things:
 - Update the Nuget package provider
 - Update the PSWindowsUpdate module
 - Start Windows Update service
 - Get the updates
 - Stop Windows Update service

Here is the good part:

```
$Updates = Get-WindowsUpdate -MicrosoftUpdate -Title "Rollup .* .NET Framework" -NotTitle "Preview" -Verbose 4>> $Log
```

What I'm doing is Getting only patches for .Net. I'm excluding preview releases. I'm using the Microsoft Update provider.
Then since I want a log I'm using -Verbose to give me info and capturing that info in the log file.

This is pretty basic right now and I'll probably need to expand this so that based off of scan results we are creating
collections in PDQ Inventory for machines that are missing specific patches.

If you have comments, let me know!
