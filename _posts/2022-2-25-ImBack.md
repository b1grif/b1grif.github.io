title: Trying to get back to it
---

Wow! My last blog was 2019... that was a crazy year. Personally, my little boy was born so I wasnt sleeping much and just trying to
take all of the new dad experiences in. Work related, we merged with another company in 2016 and finally started to get incorporated
into the corporate IT department in 2019. All the sudden my little team of 4 went from managing 150 servers in 1 datacenter
to managing 750 servers in multiple datacenters in the US and Latin America. After we started digging we came to find out there was a
lot of technical debt. 2020 was crazy with trying to scramble to get equipment to everyone who suddenly had a kid that needed
the family computer to do zoom meetings so they could attend school and just when that started to settle down, my company got hit
with a security incident which could be a whole series of blog posts about what we did and how we got through it.

Anyway, I'm going to schedule some time to try to do some blogging again. I've done a ton of stuff in Powershell the past few
years, its just been with different apps so there's plenty to think through and share!
