title: This Week In Powershell
---

One of the things i worked on this week. I had a a small report for the boss that he wanted. Well this isnt anything crazy. I grab some
data from an api parse it and then write it to a spreadsheet. Its only 3 columns (date, group1submits, and totalsubmits).
I thought that was good but he wanted to see it graphed.... well that's easy to do once but I'm adding to this report daily.
A few weeks ago I wrote a module to wrap an api with powershell to make sure that I could automate this process so I wasn't
about to go and recreate a graph every day. So I dug into the [ImportExcel module](https://github.com/dfinke/ImportExcel).
It is an excellent module that allows you do so many things with data in excel. One of those things is graphing!

So what I ended up doing was importing my data from the previous day.
```
$OldData = Import-Excel -Path $Excel
```
Grabbing the new data.
```
$Reports = Get-TriageReports -Start_Date $Start -End_Date $End
```
Adding the two together.
```
$CurrentData = $OldData + $Data
```
Here are the fun bits that took me a minute to figure out. I had to convert the array to an excel package. Then add a new
worksheet and clear that worksheet. Then I'm defining the chart and adding it. The last part is important. When you convert
the data to the excel package its a temporary file so you have to close the package and save it. That's it!

```
$Package = $CurrentData | Export-Excel -PassThru
Add-WorkSheet -ExcelPackage $Package -WorksheetName Graph -ClearSheet
$ChartDef = @{
    Worksheet = $Package.Graph
    Title = "Reports"
    ChartType = 'Line'
    XRange = "Sheet1!`$A`$2:`$A`$$($CurrentData.Count)"
    YRange = @("Sheet1!`$B`$2:`$B`$$($CurrentData.Count)","Sheet1!`$C`$2:`$C`$$($CurrentData.Count)")
    SeriesHeader = 'TotalReports','MTLReports'
    Column = 0
    Row = 0
    Width = 1500
}
Add-ExcelChart @ChartDef
Close-ExcelPackage -ExcelPackage $Package -SaveAs $Excel
```
