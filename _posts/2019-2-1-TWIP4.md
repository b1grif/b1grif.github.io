title: This Week In Powershell

This week I've done some work on a few pipelines. We have 4 types of repositories set up.

### 1 No CI/CD

Most of our repositories don't have a CI/CD pipeline set up. They're only for source control for now. I do plan to add pipelines to most or all of our repositories in the future.

### 2 Deploy Module to Internal Repository

As I create more modules. I needed a faster way to deploy modules to our internal repository so I moved it all to a pipeline. This is a huge help since it takes the module through PSAnalyzer then any unit tests and then deploys the module to our internal repository. The only bad part is making sure that the module is updated on the servers or computers that are using the modules but that's a problem for a later time.

### 3 Deploy Scripts to Job Runner

Many of our repositories are source control for scripts that are run on a schedule or ad-hoc through or job scheduler. We run the scripts through PSAnalyzer and then through unit tests. Then copy the files to our test 
job scheduler server.

Maybe in the future we'll automate moving these scripts from our test job scheduler server to the production job
scheduler server.

### 4 Deploy Application to Servers

I use CI/CD pipelines to deploy an application to multiple servers. These script are run through PSAnalyer and a battery of unit tests then they are ready to be manually kicked off to multiple servers.
