title: Pester v5
---

I know Pester v5 came out [a while ago](https://github.com/pester/Pester/releases/tag/5.0.0) and there were some major changes but I hadnt had time to dig in until now!

My big take away was how lazy I was! I have code everywhere, at the top of scripts, before any describe blocks, foreach loops around context and it blocks...really everywhere. So I've spent as much time as I could spare this week refactoring code into BeforeAll and BeforeDiscovery blocks and adding tags to all levels. I think the
most critical part going forward is to understand the Discovery vs Run phases. If you're building tests using -foreach on a Context block then the variable that stores the test cases need to be created in the BeforeDiscovery block to build the tests.

I finished migrating my module level test to v5. I also took the time to move my help tests from one .tests.ps1 that iterated through all functions to a separate .tests.ps1 file per function that includes the help for the function. We'll see which is a better approach. I'm still in the process of creating tests for my scaffolding module.

Which brings me to the realization that maybe I'll do a few more posts on Pester and then move to some posts about my build pipeline for modules.
