title: This Week In Powershell
---

This week has been a little more Pester testing and I'm looking at moving a set of functions that I wrote into a module. 
This set of functions is all for deploying one system. Currently I just dot source the functions which is working fine 
because I clone an entire repo and the functions are contained in the repo. I think that moving from a bunch of ps1 
files to a module is the first step to open sourcing this code. I think that is the direction I'd like to move especially 
because I know that other people using this product are struggling to get it deployed.

TLDR - This week has been fairly uneventful Powershell-wise.
