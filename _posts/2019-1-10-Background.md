title: Background About Me

## A little background 
I started learning Powershell and trying to do more automation the past 2 years. I am by no means an expert but 
here's what I'm working with:

VS Code
Git
Gitlab CE
Gitlab Runners for CI/CD

I built an in-house repository for my modules. I have a pipeline for some of the modules so that on commit, tests
are ran and the module is automatically updated and pushed to the repository.

## What I hope to do with this blog

My goal is to share some of the ways I've handled things so that others dont have to reinvent a solution and maybe 
even get some comments from others on how to improve what I'm doing.
