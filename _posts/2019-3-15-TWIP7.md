title: This Week In Powershell
---

I talked a little about creating a module for Triage [last week](https://b1grif.github.io/TWIP6/). This week I pretty much finished the module. It took me a while because of the way they keep date and time. On the server side everything is UTC, which really threw me for a loop when I was calling their api and getting strange results back. Eventually I found to use

```
if ($Start_Date){
    $StartDateTime = Get-Date $Start_Date
    $StartUTC = $StartDateTime.ToUniversalTime().ToString('MM/dd/yyyy')
}
if ($End_Date){
    $EndDateTime = Get-Date $End_Date
    $EndUTC = $EndDateTime.ToUniversalTime().ToString('MM/dd/yyyy')
}
```

so that I can use a string like 1/1/2019 in the parameter and have it converted to UTC. I'm also looking at doing something similar to some of the scripts from Brandon Olin's [PasswordState](https://github.com/devblackops/PasswordState) module so that we can save some information like credentials and hostname without entering them each time.
