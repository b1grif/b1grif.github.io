title: This Week In Powershell
---

I haven't posted anything the past few weeks because I've been spending time with  my wife and new baby boy. So I've barely thought about powershell and when I have it's been like 4 am and my thoughts are coherent at all. So that leads me to this week. I'm back at work and trying to get back to a semi-normal schedule and I'm back to scripting!

I don't know how many of you out there are using Cofense Triage but we do at my job and one of the things upper management has been looking at is security. So they want to see some statistics. Well Triage doesn't really have any reports out of the box but they have an API that is fairly well documented. I looked on Powershellgallery.com and no one has a module out there yet so I started writing one. Currently its pretty basic and I'm not sure how I'm going to tackle some of the options that they allow to be appended to the api call like start date and end date but maybe this is something that could be worthwhile for the community. If you've already started a module like this or have any suggestions on how to write this, please let me know!
