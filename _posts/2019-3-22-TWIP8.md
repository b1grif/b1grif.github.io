title: This Week In Powershell
---

This was a slow week powershell wise. Instead I've been looking at how to implement high availability for our websites. Currently
we have 2 websites that are hosted on-site. We now have a second location that we might be able to use but it looks like that
will require a GSLB, a second set of servers that get replicated data and another load balancer. Or we start dabbling in a
public cloud.

Well ... until next week!
