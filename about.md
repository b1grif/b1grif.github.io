I've been a Systems Administrator for over 6 years now. I've worked in healthcare, manufacturing and financial 
services. I've worked on mostly Windows but done some CentOS and Ubuntu administration as well as many types of
appliances like f5, Cisco and Brocade switches and routers, Cisco, Fortigate and Palo Alto firewalls.

Now I'm focusing on using Powershell to help me move a little quicker with each aspect of my job!
